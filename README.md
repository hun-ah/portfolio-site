# My Portfolio Website

This is the first iteration of my personal portfolio. It includes my projects, about me and a contact page.

## How It's Made:
**Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript**

**This is the first website I have fully programmed from start to finish!** I started out by wireframing how I wanted my site to look in Figma. I created sections for the content, such as an intro section, projects, about and contact. From there, I started to layer in the overall design of the website with things like how the nav bar would look, where headings would sit on the page and where I wanted my buttons to be and how they would be styled. Once I had a design I liked, I started on writing the HTML.

I tried to write the HTML in the most semantically correct way possible (based on my knowledge). I first broke everything up into sections and then added tags where I felt like they made the most sense. For example, I chose to include a header tag within my intro section to signify that this is the introductory content to my website. I also chose to use a main tag within my project section to signify the most important/main information on my website and that is to show what kind of websites and applications I have created.

After semantically writing the HTML, I started on my CSS. If I could go back and do it again, I would do a better job of organizing/setting up the CSS. For example, I would have set up some CSS variables for the colours used on my website. This would have saved me a lot of time and made my code look cleaner. With something like this in mind, I am spending more time learning how to structure my code in the best and cleanest way possible, to keep repetition to a minimum. I used comments to keep things as organized as possible. I used 3 separate CSS files, one to store my main styles, one for media queries and one for a CSS reset (which I prefer to work with).

Lastly, I added in some JavaScript to create some hover effects, to aid in my contact form submission and for my mobile menu. This was my first time using JavaScript and I wanted to experiment with some different ways of doing things. I recognize that I didn't always chose the most efficient way to do things, like how I chose to open and close my mobile menu (I used a checkbox and then had to use JavaScript to be able to close it again) but I really learned a lot by playing around with some new things!

## Optimizations:

If I had more time to currently work on the website, there are a few little things I would like to make better. I was having issues changing my button colour on mobile after touching the button, as well as not being able to easily add a smooth scroll when viewing the website on Safari. One thing I was very proud to resolve quickly was removing the zoom into an input on mobile when filling out the contact form. I also removed the blue highlight that appeared around the input when it was clicked on, that didn't fit my colour scheme, nor did it have the border radius that matched my styled input. Overall, I am really happy with the way the site looks, especially on desktop.

## Lessons Learned:

Like I mentioned above, there are some things I would have done differently. The main takeaways for me for my next project are to spend more time figuring out how I want to structure/organize my code, especially my CSS. I would probably not use a checkbox to toggle my mobile menu open and close because it actually caused more issues for me later on when trying to close the menu properly.
